              <p>We retain data:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>As long as your account remains active</li>
                <li>As required for legal and security purposes</li>
                <li>Deleted data may remain in backups for a limited period</li>

              <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
              <p>We implement:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Password hashing</li>
                <li>Role-based access control</li>
                <li>HTTPS encryption</li>
                <li>Input validation</li>
                <li>Server-level protections</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, no system is 100% secure. Users hold responsibility for
                password safety.
